Herbicides are critical components of Canada's farming practices, but have
recently come under scrutiny for their inadvertent side-effects. In particular,
they can negatively impact the rhizosphere of plants by inhibiting the
formation of root nodules. Rhizobacteria form a critical symbiotic relationship
with agriculturally important legume crops in Canada, specifically within the
communities surrounding Waterloo. These microorganisms form root nodules and
fix nitrogen gas into ammonia, a requirement for plant growth. The usage of
herbicides such as Linuron inhibits this nitrogen fixation pathway and forces
farmers to use more synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. This non-point source of
pollution is known to be detrimental and can be mitigated by ensuring that root
nodule formation is not inhibited by herbicides by engineering a herbicide
degradation pathway into rhizobia.

This year, we focused on engineering a degradation pathway for Linuron within
<i>Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens</i>.  We demonstrated that <b>FILL IN THE
BLANK</b>. That is, we have shown that farmers can reduce their use of
fertilizers while still using herbicides to ensure high crop yields.
