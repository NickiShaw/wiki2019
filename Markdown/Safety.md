# Our Lab
Our lab is located on the third floor of Biology 1 building at the University of Waterloo. We have our own tabletop centrifuges, thermal cycler, analytical and top-loading balances, -20째C freezer, and 4째C refrigerator. We share the -80째C freezer and 37째C incubator with the host lab, under the guidance and supervision of those in the Dr. Trevor Charles lab. Waterloo iGEM is thankful for the supervision and support members of the Dr. Trevor Charles lab have given our team.
